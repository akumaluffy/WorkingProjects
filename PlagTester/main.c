// ------- Takes two files and compares for plagiarism ------- // 

/* 
1. Files are .c files, convert to .txt files and compare (?)
2. Files should come from a directory containing all files
3. Process places file path of all files in directory into a string array (or maybe struct?)
4. Compares each file with all other files
5. Compare each line in file 1 with all other lines?? (this might be way too much)
6. Maybe make each file comparison a separate process and use a process manager like in HW4
